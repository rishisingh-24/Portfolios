            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                Hello, I am a dedicated and detail-oriented C & C++ Programmer with 2 years of experience. 
                My passion lies in utilizing my skills to monitor, maintain, and resolve issues related
                to web and websites while maximizing budgets. I am particularly enthusiastic about 
                achieving top rankings on Google and contributing to the design of web pages and websites.
                My skillset includes both Frontend and Backend Development, proficiency in coding languages 
                such as C, C++, and Python, and a strong foundation in Data Structures, Algorithms, and
                Database Management Systems. Additionally, I have a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and 
                Machine Learning, which I believe can greatly enhance web development.
                I pride myself on my ability to make logical decisions, my knack for multitasking, and 
                my innovative approach to problem-solving. Outside of my programming endeavors, I enjoy
                diverse interests, including excelling on coding platforms like HackerRank and Codechef, 
                participating in sports like Volleyball and Basketball, and exploring the art of photography.<br><br>
                In terms of achievements, I hold a 5-star rating on HackerRank, earned a Gold medal in 
                Chess at an Inter-School Competition, secured a Silver medal in Volleyball at a similar event,
                and clinched Gold in Painting during my high school years.
                My educational background consists of a Senior Secondary Education certification from 
                Little Flower School, where I achieved a commendable 78.6%, and a Secondary Education 
                certification with an impressive 86.7%. Currently, I am pursuing Computer Science Engineering 
                at Jaypee University of Engineering and Technology, with expected graduation in 2025.
                I am excited to leverage my skills, experiences, and passion for coding to contribute to
                the ever-evolving world of web development and technology.<br><br>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Thank you for considering my introduction.</p>
